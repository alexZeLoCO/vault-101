All of these works share common themes and elements of futuristic dystopia, urban decay, and moral ambiguity, often blending elements of noir and science fiction. Here's how each connects to those ideas:

    Shadows of Evil (Call of Duty Zombies): This is set in a noir-inspired, dark, and corrupt version of a 1940s city, with supernatural and apocalyptic elements. The characters are deeply flawed, trying to escape their pasts, and the world itself is dystopian.

    Blade Runner: A classic dystopian sci-fi film that explores a futuristic world where synthetic humans (replicants) are hunted. It features a dark, rain-soaked cityscape, questions about what it means to be human, and themes of existential despair and mortality.

    Altered Carbon: A cyberpunk TV series that takes place in a futuristic world where consciousness can be transferred between bodies. This touches on dystopian themes of identity, power, and immortality, raising questions about the value of life and human essence.

    "Nobody Wants to Die": This statement captures the existential dread and desire for survival in dystopian futures. Whether in a world with synthetic beings (like in Blade Runner) or people who can swap bodies (as in Altered Carbon), the fear of death and the lengths people go to avoid it are central to these narratives.

Common threads:

    Dystopian settings: Dark, oppressive, and often futuristic environments.
    Existential themes: Identity, morality, and the fear of death.
    Noir aesthetics: Gritty, urban landscapes, and morally ambiguous characters.
    Technological or supernatural elements: That challenge human existence or mortality.

These works use the dystopia-noir mix to explore deeper questions about life, identity, and the fear of death.

Common Traits of These Morally Ambiguous Characters:

    Personal survival or self-interest: Many of these characters are driven by personal motivations, whether it's survival (Joel in The Last of Us), revenge (Abby in Part II), or self-preservation (V in Cyberpunk 2077).
    Conflicted morality: Characters like Deckard, Dolores, and Elliot find themselves torn between conflicting values, questioning the ethics of their actions in worlds where clear distinctions between good and evil are blurred.
    Acts of violence or deception: Many morally ambiguous characters use violence or deception to achieve their goals, but often with complex justifications tied to larger themes of justice, freedom, or survival.

These characters make the stories compelling because they challenge the audience's perception of right and wrong, often operating in worlds where morality is highly subjective.
